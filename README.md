I’m excited to share my Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis Dashboard project 📊

In this project, I analyzed sales data to identify trends across regions, customer segments, and discount levels. I built interactive KPIs and dashboards using SQL and Power BI to derive actionable business insights.

🔹 Tools Used: Power BI | Excel 
🔹 Key Insight: High discount strategies negatively impacted profitability
🎯 What I Learned from This Project
How to design dashboards from a business perspective
Importance of choosing the right visuals
How small insights can lead to big business impact
How data analytics connects directly with real-world problems
